When joining a new place, many devs may have similar situation as [this artical](http://goo.gl/8n7hZv) described:

>I found myself wading through a codebase laced with technical debt and augmented with little documentation and no unit tests, written in a Java-like language called ActionScript that I wasn’t familiar with. I had two weeks to build and launch a feature already promised to video publishers, a feature that would allow them to schedule when their online videos would go on the air.

And later some better onboarding experiences made him think what a good process should be.

**First, does it worth to invest time to onboarding process?**

> The onboarding process is an opportunity to direct the learning and the activity of a new hire toward what the team believes matters most.

**Quora's goals when designing the process**

- Ramp up a new employee as quickly as possible
- Impart the startup’s culture and values
- Expose the new employee to the breadth of fundamentals needed to succeed
  - Those engineers who learned the fundamental tools and abstractions well will do better
- Socially integrate the new employee onto the team

There're more details to describe how they archive these goals.
