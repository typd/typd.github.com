The best software writing I is a book contains Joel Spolsky's selection and some comments of articals around 2004 or so, while this is the Joel of "Joel on Software". I found the orginal posts' links are available in this doubaner's [review](http://book.douban.com/review/1449189/). Some worth a read, some worth to be shared,

+ [Great Hackers](http://paulgraham.com/gh.html) by Paul Graham, you know "Hackers and Painters"

  It's a long post with nice words.

  A great hacker has much much more productivity than a normal developer. Someone says there're 5 levels of developers, the productivity scales 10 between each 2 levels.

  Hackers have strong curiosity, the intention to know how things work.

  No guarantee on whether someone can become a hacker or not. Raw talent, habit, even personality decides your potential. It's even hard to identify if someone is a hacker.

  Release the hackers!

+ [How many Microsoft employees does it take to change a lightbulb?](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2003/10/28/53298.aspx)

  Microsoft seems to be an old-fasion in software world to me. The software technics and theories have changed a lot since delivered software is not as popular as cloud ones. We should all know the differences. The key to the first one is stability, every change there is expensive, while the later one we need most is rapid developing and delivering.

  No matter what, I really admire Microsoft delivers softwares as complicated as windows and office, even having thousands of developers work on one project is a miracal, needs excellent software engineering with no doubt.
