[Revolution OS](http://www.bilibili.com/video/av909925/) is a movie about the birth of GNU, Linux, open source definition and so on.

Free software movement and Open Source

- Free software movement aims to the attitude of life. Open source is more about publishing the source code of software.
  - "GNU is an operating system that is free softwareâ€”that is, it respects users' freedom. The development of GNU made it possible to use a computer without software that would trample your freedom." http://www.gnu.org/
  - Open source definition http://opensource.org/osd/

GNU and Linux

- GNU tended to release people from using private software. It completed the software first, but stucked on writing the kernel. Then linux came out to be a perfect kernel fit. People combined those two and called GNU/Linux. Later on, other distributions of linux like SuSE/Linux, Red Hat linux came out.
- Linus said himself is an "engineer", while Richard Stallman is a "philosopher".
