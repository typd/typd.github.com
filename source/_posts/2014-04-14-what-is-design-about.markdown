This is a [good talk](http://goo.gl/bcjRYc) tells "what is design about".

- Focus, deliver quality 
- Compromise 
- Think about the context 
- Worry about the right thing: users' problem, not yours 
  - Design thinking must trickle down 
    - "Great design is a symptom of a design-led org structure & engineering process" 
    - Design is not democratic 
    - Design is not beautiful pictures either: can't separate engineering and design 
- Design is about: understanding humans, and make things for humans 
  - psychology 
  - neuroscience 
  - linguistics 
  - sociology 
  - philosophy 
- Empathy, details matter

The presenter gave a good example of washing machine at the end. Remind me of designing an interface in programming.
