When many things become mature, they start to get a simple philosophy, but cover a lot of thoughts underneath. That's the abstraction of all complexities. Like Zen.

This phenomenon can be seen on some hand made craft, like a program from a programmer. But it's always difficult to expose the beauty of it, with an easy, friendly way that non-programmer can recognize. Or say, only real master with deep love of life can do it right. Like [this one](http://www.baroque.me/).

Can't express my praise enough on this.

- Need sounds on while you watching the balls.
- The circles, strings, with right speed, are playing Bach's Cello Suites in a way I've never thought of.
- Just as beautiful as Bach's Cello Suites.

From the [author's words](http://blog.chenalexander.com/2011/baroque-bach-cello/), you can know the complexities behind scene. Also some [other works](http://work.chenalexander.com/) from [him](http://work.chenalexander.com/bio). If you still remember the [string logo of google](http://www.google.com/logos/2011/lespaul.html), yes, it's created by him.

When a person become mature, he'll also get a simple mind, be generous, friendly to others and himself.
