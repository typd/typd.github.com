Information technology is a fast industry now. Companies come and go. People keep thinking about new strategy of management in such rapid growing. [Facebook engineering VP](http://ondrejka.net/) gives an [experience sharing](http://firstround.com/article/Facebook-VP-of-Engineering-on-Solving-Hard-Things-Early) talk, which has many good points. Below are some quotes with my comments.

# Common mistakes

> - Every early stage company thinks it has reinvented management. In fact they have not! 
> - Management is not about who is who’s boss. Management is the opportunity to explicitly choose tradeoffs. No silver bullet for all!

It's very good point that you should know the pros and cons of the management style you chose.

# For early management

> - Build management and organizational structures around the strengths your company needs to succeed. 
> - Recognize and plan for the weaknesses that you know are inherent in the structures you pick. 
> - Build great habits around communication and decision-making when everyone still knows each other well.

# Culture

## Why you need it from start 
> - In a small team, every one can learn from founders, but when it scales, information gets lost. 
> - “Culture is defined by differing from the norm. It can’t be like everyone else’s.”

## Practical methods of building it 
> - The CEO must own encoding and transmitting culture. 
> - Write down what makes your company different. 
> - Describe culture in ways that  make people think and debate rather than universally agree.

## Facebook's lesson 
> Facebook’s “Move Fast and Break Things” tagline is a canonical example. It has challenged every new employee to realize it's worth some amount of risk to keep innovating, experimenting and moving forward. And to avoid becoming overly conservative even when a mistake could impact a billion people.

# Conclusion

> Building great management and great culture is never easy nor complete, but both are much harder to tackle when product has already shipped. Take advantage of the benefits of build phase to start early and tackle these hard problems before they become so massive they put the company’s success on the line.
