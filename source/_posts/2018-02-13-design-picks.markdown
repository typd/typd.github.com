With interests on design, this talk really took me some time to prepare, re-read books, organize ideas, pay attention to everyday objects...

"Design thinking" gives a new view to everything around.

<div id="pdf-20180213" style="width:600px;height:400px"></div>
<script>
var options = {
  pdfOpenParams: {
  pagemode: "thumbs",
  navpanes: 0,
  toolbar: 0,
  statusbar: 0,
  view: "FitV"
  }
};
PDFObject.embed("/res/design-picks/20170221-design-picks.pdf", "#pdf-20180213", options);
</script>
