[A talk](http://yixi.tv/lecture/314) from the founder of wooyun.

As he said, the motivation was the illness of the web security industry.

- Web companies value themselves by how much user info they hold
- But they care more about their business rather than the responsibility/safety
- Only big companies would have security stuff. Even though they are far from doing a good job.
- Users should care the security, but their interests are disturbed away, by the companies. Users don't/can't really know about the scenes behind.
- The companies ignore security issues even more as users don't care.

That's a dead lock. Also that's a bad ecosystem of the hackers. They would take the advantage of the leaks rather than report back to the source, which don't care too much.

To jump out there, someone should do "the right thing" remarkably. That is, attract hackers to report leaks to the source through a public influential channel. Make companies treat them seriously, and open to public after fixing.

Easier said than done. Technicals, influence, and patience are needed.

More and more data are getting on cloud. In this age, so many things are being unified. One may have huge impact to all, either it's something good, or bad, or even a disaster. Unifing means risks, fragilities. But people are still pursuing better experience, modern life. This is a social evolution nobody can reverse. Only science fictions know the end.
