I was just watching a conf video which mentioned a graph I've seen before.

I've interviewed a candidate from a research department of that company. He showed me this graph and said his project was about automatically generating store line graph like this. Use algorithms like DP, to re-order and group the character lines, reduce cross point count, etc. Those ideas make sense to me.
