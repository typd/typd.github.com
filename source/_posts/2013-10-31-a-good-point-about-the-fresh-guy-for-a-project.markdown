Just heard this:

> The newest person to the project is really useful, because of his fresh eyes, that would point out what's broken or fix processes.

Good point! For engineering quality, culture and communication, it's recommended to do more code and architecture reviews cross teams. I heard some agile web companies even rotate developers among different projects. That sounds awesome to me, although it may have a slow start and bring in some uncertainty.

To have the guys as smart as developers to collaborate well, some social practices become neccessary and more important.
