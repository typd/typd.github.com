I gave a talk to fresh graduates recently. Look backward is helpful.

<div id="pdf-20171228" style="width:600px;height:400px"></div>
<script>
var options = {
  pdfOpenParams: {
  pagemode: "thumbs",
  navpanes: 0,
  toolbar: 0,
  statusbar: 0,
  view: "FitV"
  }
};
PDFObject.embed("/res/programmer-growth/201712-programmer-growth.pdf", "#pdf-20171228", options);
</script>
