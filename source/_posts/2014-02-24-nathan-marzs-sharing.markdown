    Q: How to improve your skills as a programmer?
    A: I get better by doing a lot of programming and trying new things. One of the best ways to become a better programmer is to learn new programming languages. By learn I mean more than just learning the syntax of the language, I mean understanding the language's idioms and writing something substantial in it. ...

    Q: Main lessons you learned in the last few years of your professional career?
    A: Feedback is everything. For product development and managing a team.

    Q: Process of building a software system?
    A: The general idea is to avoid making "general" or "extensible" solutions until you have a very deep understanding of the problem domain. ... The sequence is "First make it possible. Then make it beautiful. Then make it fast."

    Q: What are the best programmers in common do you think?
    A: The best programmers are obsessed with improving as programmers. They love exploring new programming languages and new ideas. Another key trait of great programmers is a "getting stuff done" mentality. It's far more important to get something working than to make the perfect design. Plus a great programmer recognizes that you can't make a perfect design without first having something working that you can learn from.

    Q: What do you do in improve your writing skill?
    A: Write a lot. Get feedback. Read a lot and try to learn from great writers.

Sometimes, experience is important not because it tells something new, but because it confirms something you know.
