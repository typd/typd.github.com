Just watched [this documentary](http://www.letv.com/ptv/vplay/2181407.html) of Jeremy Lin, highlights the crazy days of him last year. The story looks like all other inspiration ones,

- He has played well all before graduating from Harvard, until has to think about the future.
- Luckily Golden States team gave an offer. But mostly because he played with the son of the team's new owner. Been cut finally.
- Been picked again. Travel between lower level league and main league back and force several times. Been cut again.
- Got another offer from struggling NY. Screw up a game. Slept on a short couch before the possible last game in career, at the edge of being cut the 3rd time. 
- For someone stands right besides the dream, but others give you no hope, would think he has nothing to lose. If this is the last game, you'll be very concentrated and do all you can. After scored, he thought "they have no reason to cut me now". That emotion pushed him to a new level.
- Then everyone knows him. Before the game with Kobe, Kobe was asked about him and answered in a fuzzy or ambiguous way, "I don't know who he is, who you're talking about". Anyone wants to survive on the league should not accept that. After the game, he was asked "do you think Kobe knows you now?". He was tempted to say "who the hell is Kobe?", but then he thought "what would Jesus do?", answered "you need to ask Kobe".

Lin got to a new level after the journey. "You don't get better if you win all the time. You get better when you lose. You look like yourself more. Go through tough time, that's a perfect plan".

I've watched several other NBA players' documentaries before, too. All of these can bring you strong emotion with exciting shots, slum dunks, especially when you relate them to the stories behind scene. The competition sports then look like a reality show more. Money, ethnic, culture, nationality are involved to the game. Just as complex as life. But after you have accepted that, it's still simple: your strength helps you to get on the stage, your faith determines where you gonna stop.
