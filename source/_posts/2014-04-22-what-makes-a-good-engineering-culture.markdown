I had many posts talk about engineering culture. Here's [a good one](http://goo.gl/2VlzmQ) from others summaries the characters of a good culture.

> - Optimize for iteration speed
>   - Team-wise, fast iteration speed means having a set of strong leaders to help coordinate and drive team efforts
> - Push relentlessly toward automation
>   - deploying, testing, etc
> - Build the right software abstractions
> - Develop a focus on high code quality with code reviews
> - Maintain a respectful work environment
> - Build shared ownership of code
> - Allot 20% time
> - Build a culture of learning and continuous improvement
> - Hire the best

This can be a check list for evaluating a company.
