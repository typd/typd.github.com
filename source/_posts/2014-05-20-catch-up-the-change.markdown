A senior co-worker gave a talk about his work and philosophy, which is interesting.

His team called "DevOps" has build the internal development infrastructure, similar to AWS (manage machines) and heroku (service container), and other common tools. Those are useful and critical, but "not the goal of the team". The motivation was not to build the Paas (internal heroku) itself, but to unify the developers way of handling the details around a service, like deployment, dependencies, logging, etc. (heroku has a high level [spec to explain the idea](http://12factor.net/)). We don't want to sacrifice either speed or quality. To achieve that, building the service container platform is a smart choice, for coaching devs, and improving quality. So the idea behind, is really about improving the tech culture.

Jump out of there, this "implicit" way of doing things is rather "interesting". The modern software development is creative and collaborative, especially for quality ones. It has become a social practise in many ways. Not only the market, requirements, dev language, tools, knowledge are changing, people also come and go. It's not always pratical to "force" all acting in a certain way. But you can "lead" the majority to catch up the change.
