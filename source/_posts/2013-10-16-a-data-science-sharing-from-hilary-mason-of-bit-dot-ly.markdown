This is a [good talk](https://bitly.com/A5Mjsv) from Chief Scientist at bit.ly. It's interesting to use and present your data wisely indeed. And I'm more interested at the factors make this a good talk

+ The solid work and thinking behind
+ A logical structure of the talk
+ The attitude of sharing, not just showing off the done work or owned data
+ A good researcher needs to have a practical tool set, and good engineering sense
